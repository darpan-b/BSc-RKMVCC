REGULAR EXPRESSION TO NFA AND CONVERT IT INTO A DFA
Q10. Write the regular expression for the language starting and ending with 'a' and having combination of 'b' in between.
Q11. Write the regular expression for the language accepting all the strings in which any number of 'a' is followed by any number of 'b' is followed by any number of 'c'.
Q12. Write the regular expression for the language starting with 'a' but not having consecutive 'b's.
Q13. Write the regular expression for the language accepting all the strings which are starting with 1 and ending with 0, over $\sum=\{0, 1\}$.
